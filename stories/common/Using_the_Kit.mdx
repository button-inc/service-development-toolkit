# Getting Started with the Toolkit

## How to use the Components

<!-- Due to how MDX v1 handles JSX & MD, any lines with props need to be in JSX -->
<!-- see https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/6072#issuecomment-989516658 -->
<!-- MDX v2 is optional as of Storybook v6.5, so there is potential for refactoring in the future -->

<ol>
  <li>Install the package: <code>npm i @button-inc/{props.theme}-theme</code></li>
  <li>Import the components: <code>import Card from @button-inc/{props.theme}-theme/Card</code></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: you can also import components using the syntax <code>import &#123;Card&#125; from @button-inc/{props.theme}-theme</code>, however the above method will reduce bundle size and is recommended.</em></p>

3. Include the component in your code: `<Card>Click!</Card>`

## Progressive Enhancement

While the toolkit provides an easy to use theme and is compatible with client-side-rendering frameworks like
create-react-app, to support the progressive enhancement features a server-side-rendering framework is required to
support sending html to the client. Getting setup in the frameworks Gatsby and Nextjs is shown below.

### Nextjs

The text below shows a quick way to get setup in a nextjs project. For more information on the framework, see [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/).

1. Create a template application: from the directory you want your app to be in, run `npx create-next-app my-new-app-name`
2. After installation completes, go to the project: `cd my-new-app-name`
<li>Install the package: <code>npm i @button-inc/{props.theme}-theme</code></li>
4. Replace all contents of _pages/index.js_ with the following code:

<pre><code>{`
import Header from '@button-inc/${props.theme}-theme/Header';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
`}</code></pre>

5. Run `npm run dev` to see your site.

### Gatsby

1. Follow Gatsby's [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/) to get your environment setup. Once you have completed the [run your site locally](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-1/#run-your-site-locally) step, continue to step 2.
<li>Install the package: <code>npm i @button-inc/{props.theme}-theme</code></li>
3. Replace the contents of _src/pages/index.js_ with the code below:

<pre><code>{`
import * as React from "react"
import Header from '@button-inc/${props.theme}-theme/Header';

// markup
const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <Header />
  )
}

export default IndexPage
`}</code></pre>


4. Run `npm run develop` to see your site.

## Props

Components will pass along the props they receive, including html attributes and event handlers. If the component is comprised of multiple
elements, the props will pass to the outermost container unless otherwise specified. On top
of the custom props listed, you can pass event handlers and html attributes to components.
