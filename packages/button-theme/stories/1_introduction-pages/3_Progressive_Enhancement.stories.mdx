# Progressive Enhancement

## Making sure everyone can access the services they need.

---

Progressive enhancement is an approach that essentiallyÂ **starts with a good foundation**. This perspective shift focuses on content first - ensuring that content can be accessed by anyone, anywhere.

## Progressive Enhancement in action

<div className="images-container">
  <div className="image-container">
    <img src={card_html} style={{width: '512px'}} alt="Card component in plain html" />
    Plain HTML
  </div>
  <div className="image-container">
    <img src={card_js} style={{width: '512px'}} alt="Card component with css & javascript applied" />
    With JavaScript + CSS
  </div>
</div>

Sometimes our users can only see the basic structure of a page. Throughout the toolkit, you can toggle between JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to see what users would see at different levels of accessibility.
At the top of each page, the toolbar gives you the option to shift the component between states of html only, html with css included, and html with css and javascript.
<img src={pe_controls} alt="progressive enhancement controls"/>

## People can see a different version of a service when:

---

- They have a bad internet connection
- They are on an older device
- They have voluntarily blocked JavaScript

## How hard is it to implement?

---

Turns out it's actually not that hard to incorporate! It's just a matter of using components designed with accessibility in mind.

We have built progressive enhancement into our toolkit to make creating accessible services as easy as possible. Each component is built with a strong HTML 5 foundation, with CSS and JavaScript layered on top as experience enhancements for devices that can accommodate them.
